# Bulk Transfer UI and Server

This repository contains a simple UI and a server for handling bulk transfers of MAR ERC20 tokens using the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly way to send tokens to multiple recipients in one go, directly from your browser, with the help of MetaMask.

## Files

- `server.js`: This is a simple Express.js server to serve the static bulk-transfer-ui.html file.

- `bulk-transfer-ui.html`: This HTML file provides a UI to perform bulk token transfers. You'll need to paste the token contract address and the list of recipients and amounts in CSV format. It also allows you to approve a token allowance via MetaMask.

## Setup
